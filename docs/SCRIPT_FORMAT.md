# Script Format (for writers)

This is for anyone writing dialog content who doesn't want to touch JSON —
a collaborator, a co-writer, anyone. Write a plain `.txt` file in this
format, drop it in a chapter's `manuscript/` folder, run one command, and
it becomes real game content. No code, no braces, no quotes to escape.

## Where files go

```
src/chapters/<chapter-id>/manuscript/<npc-name>.txt   <- you write this
src/chapters/<chapter-id>/content/<npc-name>.json     <- generated, don't hand-edit
```

## Building it

```bash
npm run build:content
```

Converts every `manuscript/*.txt` file in every chapter into the matching
`content/*.json` file. Run this after editing a manuscript, then commit
both the `.txt` and the regenerated `.json` together.

## The format

One file per NPC. Here's a complete real example
(`src/chapters/lake-ulysses/manuscript/deborah.txt`, trimmed to one node):

```
NPC: DEBORAH
LOCATION: 2
ACCENT: var(--color-deborah)

=== deborah_01
PROMPT: God took my boy when He needed him. I just have to trust that.
FEELZ: Anger, Fear, Anticipation

-- TRUTH
SAY: Your faith didn't protect him. Someone failed him.
REACT: She flinches. Her bible shifts in her grip.
EFFECTS: integrity+2 lucidity+1 stability-2 trust-1
DEBT: 0
NEXT: deborah_02_confronted

-- LIE
SAY: God has a plan. He's at peace.
REACT: Her smile widens. Too wide. The wallpaper flickers green.
EFFECTS: integrity-2 stability+2 trust+1
DEBT: +4
TAGS: Faith, Health
LEDGER: You told Deborah God took her son on purpose.
NEXT: deborah_02_denial
```

### File header (once per file)

- `NPC:` — the character's name, in caps, as it should display in-game.
- `LOCATION:` — which numbered stop in the chapter this NPC is (see the
  chapter's other manuscript files for what numbers are already used).
- `ACCENT:` — a CSS color for this NPC's visual accent. Use
  `var(--color-<name>)` and add the matching variable to `src/style.css`
  if this is a brand new NPC (ask if unsure).

### A node (one screen the player sees)

Starts with `=== <node_id>`. The node id is just a short internal name —
players never see it — but it has to be unique in the file and is how
`NEXT:` refers back to it. Convention: `<npcname>_<number>[_<qualifier>]`,
e.g. `deborah_01`, `deborah_02_denial`.

- `PROMPT:` — what the NPC says, the line the player is reacting to.
- `FEELZ:` — which 3 feelings show as picker options for this moment.
  Right now the only three that exist are `Anger`, `Fear`, `Anticipation`
  — list them in whatever order you want them to appear.

### A swipe (what happens for Truth vs. Lie)

Every node needs exactly two: `-- TRUTH` and `-- LIE`.

- `SAY:` — the line the player "says" if they pick this side.
- `REACT:` — how the NPC responds. This is what actually displays after
  the swipe.
- `EFFECTS:` — how this changes the player's four meters. Space-separated,
  each one `statname` immediately followed by `+N` or `-N`. Valid stat
  names: `integrity`, `trust`, `stability`, `lucidity`. Skip any stat this
  choice doesn't touch — you don't have to list all four. See
  `CONTENT_SCHEMA.md`'s "What the stats mean" section for what each one
  represents narratively (short version: truth usually raises integrity
  and lucidity and costs stability/trust; lies usually invert that).
- `DEBT:` — how much this adds to Truth Debt. Almost always `0` on the
  TRUTH side. On the LIE side, roughly `+2` for a small lie up to `+4` for
  a big one — look at other nodes for a feel of scale.
- `TAGS:` (optional, only really matters for lies) — comma-separated
  freeform categories, e.g. `Faith, Health`. Skip the line entirely if
  there's nothing worth tagging.
- `LEDGER:` (optional) — a short third-person line describing the lie,
  used later in the Reckoning. Only include this if the choice is a lie
  worth being confronted with at the end. Skip the line entirely for
  truths, or for lies too small to matter.
- `NEXT:` — which node this leads to, or `(end)` if this is the last
  thing this NPC says (the game moves on to whoever's next).

## Rules that will make the build fail (on purpose)

- Every `EFFECTS:` token must be one of the four stat names above,
  immediately followed by a signed number, no spaces (`integrity+2`, not
  `integrity + 2`).
- Every swipe block must be `-- TRUTH` or `-- LIE`, spelled exactly that
  way (case-insensitive).
- Unrecognized lines throw an error naming the file and line number —
  it's telling you it doesn't understand that line, not that something
  is broken elsewhere.

## What this format doesn't cover yet

Endings (`content/endings.json`) aren't part of this pipeline — that
file's shape is different (ending name → title/text), and small enough
to hand-edit directly for now. Cutscenes and mini-games (see
`SCENE_TYPES.md`) don't have a manuscript format yet either, since
neither is built. Both are natural extensions of this same idea once
there's real content for them.
